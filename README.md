### App Idea Evaluation

- Category: Social / Life Skills

- Mobile: Not necessarily, however it will make it easier for student who will be using the service.
- Story: Teaches individuals interested in tech how to conduct technical interviews with recruiters. 
- Market: Any job seeker can use the app.
- Habit: Use the app for a span of 6-12 months until the skills needed to be fluent in the interview process has been solidified. 
- Scope: Allow job seekers (mainly students) to learn about job interviews easier than existing resources
